# Advent of Code 2019

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode/2019). All code is base R (3.6.2), the only exception being Day 22 where `{gmp}` is needed.

To install `gmp` on your Debian-based system *prior to* installing the R package do `sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev` 

Each script can be sourced independently and will check against the correct solution. Intermediate outputs are suppressed by default, prompts are automatically filled in.

`run_all.R` runs all scripts in order and outputs execution times.
